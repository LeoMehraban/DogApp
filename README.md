# DogApp
an electron app



to build in dev mode, you need git and node.js. after installing git and node.js, run the commands
1. `git clone https://github.com/LeoMehraban/DogApp.git`
2. `cd DogApp`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start`

this is the only way (for now) to build for linux and windows

mac users, go to https://leomehraban.github.io/DogApp-Website/ and follow the insutions on that page to downlad a preabult DogApp.
